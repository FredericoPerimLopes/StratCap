## Conclusion

The StratCap platform requires significant development work before it can meet PRD requirements. While the foundational architecture is sound, critical business functionality is missing. **The platform is NOT ready for production use** and requires focused development on core financial workflows and user interfaces.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Prioritize capital activity workflow implementation
2. Build waterfall calculation engine
3. Implement fund configuration interfaces
4. Replace placeholder UI components

**Overall Risk Assessment: HIGH** - Major functionality gaps prevent business operations.
