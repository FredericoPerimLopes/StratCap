## üîß Business Logic Highlights

### Management Fee Calculations
```typescript
// Time-weighted calculation with daily precision
const annualizedRate = feeRate.times(periodDays).dividedBy(365);
const grossFeeAmount = basisAmount.times(annualizedRate);
```

### Carried Interest Logic
```typescript
// Excess returns calculation with preferred return
const excessReturns = totalReturns.minus(preferredReturn);
const carriedInterest = excessReturns.isPositive() 
  ? excessReturns.times(carriedInterestRate) 
  : new Decimal(0);
```

### Fee Offset Application
```typescript
// Net calculation after offsets and waivers
const netAmount = grossAmount.minus(totalOffsets).minus(totalWaivers);
```

## ‚úÖ Integration Points

### Existing Models
- **Fund**: Uses management fee rate, carried interest rate, preferred return rate
- **Commitment**: Used for commitment-based calculations
- **Investment**: Used for carried interest performance calculations
- **CapitalActivity**: Used for cash flow analysis
- **Transaction**: Source for transaction fee offsets
- **User**: Approval tracking for offsets and waivers

### Waterfall Integration
- Carried interest calculations integrate with waterfall models
- Distribution events can trigger carried interest calculations
- Fee basis calculations support waterfall allocation needs

### Allocation Services
- Fee calculations can be allocated to investors
- Support for pro-rata and custom allocation methods
- Integration with commitment-based allocations

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive request validation using express-validator
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
- Business rule validation in services

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in all service methods
- Meaningful error messages for business rule violations
- HTTP status code compliance

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints in database models
- Validation of calculation totals
- Approval workflow enforcement

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed foreign keys for fast lookups
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Efficient date range queries

### Calculation Efficiency
- Decimal.js for precise financial calculations
- Bulk operations for offset approvals
- Efficient time-weighted calculations

### Caching Opportunities
